            <h6>Sir Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال‎; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938) was a South Asian Muslim
                writer, philosopher, and politician, whose poetry in the Urdu language is among the greatest of the
                twentieth century, and whose vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of
                British-ruled India was to animate the impulse for Pakistan. He is commonly referred to by the
                honorific Allama (from Persian: علامہ‎, romanized: ʿallāma, lit. 'very knowing, most learned').</h6>
            <h6>Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation across the
                world, but in particular in South Asia; a series of lectures he delivered to this effect were published
                as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. A leader in the All India Muslim League, he
                envisioned—in his 1930 presidential address—a separate political framework for Muslims in British-ruled
                India.After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, he was named the national poet there. He is also known as
                the "Hakeem-ul-Ummat" (“The Sage of the Ummah”) and the "Muffakir-e-Pakistan" (“The Inceptor of
                Pakistan”). The anniversary of his birth (Yom-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl) on 9 November was a public
                holiday in Pakistan.</h6>

                        annual session of Anjuman Himayat-i-Islam, the first of such poems that would be included in his
